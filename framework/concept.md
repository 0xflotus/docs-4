# Concept
Spiral framework has build as internal platform/tool to modularize development 
of various applications by improving re-usability to written code. Components
including database, ORM, ODM and Stemplter has been build around the idea of writing
applications inside applications by providing namespacing and isolation of
every possible level of your application. 

Existed components are loosely coupled not only to each other, but potentially 
to your application as well to provide long term support and updates without
massing code rewriting.

Current implementation of core classes and components intended to be kept light
and not overcompilcated to ensure that no projects getting forced into specific
architure and developer are given with enough room for experimentation.
