# Roadmap
Spiral Framework and it's components are on stage of finalized development, no major features or changes are expected in nearest future. Development roadmap are mainly focused on improving code quality and polishing existed functionality.

Following steps are currently in a pipeline:
* Documentation [in process]
* Few tutorials and quick start videos
* Authorization module with integration with ORM (and maybe ODM), i'm still thinking about the most optimal implementation (heading to RBAC with NIST model level 2b)
* Universal administration panel with flexible design, RBAC (NIST) and set of generators - http://prntscr.com/8cwddl
* Tests coverage

Feel free to propose your help or suggestions.
