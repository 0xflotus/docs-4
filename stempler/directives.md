# Stempler - Directives
Besides classic echo constructions the Stempler supports a number of Blade-like directives to control the business 
logic of your templates.

Unlike Blade or Twig, the Stempler directives only responsible for business logic management. See [Components and Props](/stempler/components.md) 
and [Inheritance](/stempler/inheritance.md) to check how to extend your templates and implement virtual components.
