## ODM Component Overview
Spiral ODM components provides ability to define [compositions and aggregations] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition) of DataEntity classes. Such functionality can be really useful to specify application specific database schema, as result ODM has pre-built integration with MongoDB, hovewer you might also use ODM documents for other purposes, such as API mapping, other database sources and JSON documents. 
> ODM component does not have Entity Cache as ORM one. Be careful loading related models data (see aggregations).
