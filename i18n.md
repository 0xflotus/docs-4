# Localization
Spiral provides emdedded component to perform contextual location for classes and view - Translator. 
Component can be requested directly as `Translator`, via shortcut `i18n` or using facade `I18n`.

To get component instance or facade read following topics: [Core Components] (core/bindings.md), 
[Facades] (core/facades.md). 

> Before you'll skip this section because "i don't need translation" - i18n component can be used not only to perform real translation to mutliple languages but much easier way to manager application text resources even only for one language. It means that if you'll want to
edit some error message, view string or etc. you may do it wihout opening code editor.

## Principals
Spiral i18n component is build on idea of using original string is base language as localization key (same method used in GetText), the only difference between GetText and spiral i18n component that last stores localization string in separate files (in future `bundles`).
Such method provides better memory management for bigger applications and group strings based on parent view, class or file.

Basic usage of i18n can be represented by following code:

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome');
```

To start localizing your code you don't need to modify any php file as in other frameworks, spiral will automatically register string on first usage or via indexation (see Indexation section).

In some cases when bundle name doesnt matter (generic messages), you can transate string by using simpified function (in this case all maessages will come from "default" bundle).

```php
echo l('Welcome');
``` 

You can also use Translator component directly without facade, however
this way is not recommended due spiral will not be able to index and capture used strings via static analysis.

## Replacements
You can also use string interpolation while translating, to do that simply provide parameter with array of replacements. This will add more context to your message.

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

echo I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);
echo l('Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);

```

## Pluralization
Spiral provides convinient way to get pluralized string: you can either use facade, but as all plural messages always stored in one bundle (bundle name is specified in i18n configuration) it's more reasonable to use helper function `p`. 

```php
echo p('%s user', $userCount);
```

Provided code will find find appropriate string version of (`%s user`)
and inject number into it. 

> You can provide third boolean parameter to enable or disable number formatting (enabled by default).

Pluralization string resolved based on language formula described in i18n configuration and works differently for different languages.
For example English has only 2 forms, when Russian 3. You can find language formulas for different languages here TODO: INCLUDE LINK.

> Pluralization functions are also indexable and can be grabbed without manually registering strings.

Spiral will not generate plural string form automatically, you have either edit bundle file (usually located in application/runtime/i18n/language/plural-phrases.php) to add correct forms or use import/export
functionality.

## Localizing views
Besides using localization functions in view source (both is runtime and compiled php's) you can perform localization via simplified string constructions by adding `[[` and `]]` to your string.

```html
...
	<a href="#">[[Logout]]</a>
	<p>
	[[Strings like that will be automatically indexed and
	replaced in a view compilation stage.]]
	</p>
...
```

Strings like that will be automatically indexed and replaced in a view compilation stage.
> Result of view localization is cached, so you can literally localize anything you want without worring about performance or memory usage. However you have to wipe or re-generate view cache after modifying your i18n bundle files.

## Localizing class messages
Spiral gives you special component trait that can be used to create bundle based on component aliases. Check following example.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

Trait will allow not only usage of `i18nMessage` method but will additionally index every string declared in default property value and embraced with `[[` and `]]`.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

> `[[` and `]]` are not required for i18nMessage() method but this prefix and postfix will be automatically removed to allow localizing strings defined as default property values.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage($this->messages['welcome']);
	}
}
```
> This technique weidely used to specifily custom error mesagges for ODM and ORM validations.

```php

class User extends Document
{	
	...
	
	protected $validates = array(
		'email' => array(
			['required', 'error' => '[[Email is required.]]'],
			['email', 'error' => '[[Invalid email.]]']
		)
	);
}
```

You can also use i18nMessage() statically outside your class/model method, such usages are also captured well.

```php
echo HomeController::i18nMessage('Message from HomeController.');
```

> Both ORM and ODM models has LocalizableTrait enabled by default and can translate validation messages.

## Indexation
In many cases your string translation functions are located in blocks
which executed based on some condition or etc. This means that spiral will not be able to capture and register such translations automatically. However, you can perform static analysis of your code
by rurring console command `i18n:index`. This command will detect all
possible string usages in files (as fucntions) and classes (`self::i18nMessage()` method).

> Spiral can't capture strings translated using non static method of simplified function (like `$this->i18n->get(...)` or `$this->i18nMessage()`).

## Edit translation
Once you captured all your strings you can edit content of your bundle files manually by editing their content in `application/runtime/i18n/language/` directory. Every bundle represent as simple php array and can be edited fairly easy.

## Edit translation even better
For many reasons you can't give set of php files to translators. Fortunatelly spiral has very easy way to export and import localization files into GetText PO format. Such format can be edited by many programs and can significantly simplify translation process.

[SCREENSHOT]

To export specified language to PO file execute:

After editing file you can import it back via (language name already embedded into file so you don't need to specify it).

> PO fully support plural phrases and can work with different language formulas.

## Runtime message edit
If you want to change string translation in runtime concider using set method of Translator (example given for controller action).

```php
$this->i18n->set('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', 'Hi, {name}!');
```
