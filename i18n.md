# Localization
Spiral provides an embedded component to perform contextual location for classes and views - the Translator. 
This component can be requested directly as `Translator`, via the `i18n` shortcut or by using the facade `I18n`.

To get a component instance or facade read the following topics: [Core Components] (core/bindings.md), 
[Facades] (core/facades.md). 

> Before you skip this section because "I don't need translation" - the i18n component can be used not only to perform real translations to multiple languages but is a much easier way to manager application text resources even if it's only for one language. It means that if you want to
edit an error message, view string or etc. you can do it wihout opening a code editor.

## Principals
The Spiral i18n component is build on the idea of using the original string in the base language as the localization key (same method used in GetText), the only difference between GetText and the spiral i18n component is that the latter stores the localization strings in separate files (in the future `bundles`).
This method provides better memory management for bigger applications and groups strings based on the parent view, class or file.

The basic usage of i18n can be represented by following code:

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome');
```

To start localizing your code you don't need to modify any php file as in other frameworks, spiral will automatically register the string on first usage or via indexation (see Indexation section).

In some cases when the bundle name doesn't matter (generic messages), you can translate strings by using simpified functions (in this case all messages will come from the "default" bundle).

```php
echo l('Welcome');
``` 

You can also use the Translator component directly without facade, however
this way is not recommended because spiral will not be able to index and capture used strings via static analysis.

## Replacements
You can also use string interpolation while translating. To do that simply provide the parameter with an array of replacements. This will add more context to your message.

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

echo I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);
echo l('Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);

```

## Pluralization
Spiral provides a convenient way to get pluralized string: you can either use a facade, or more commonly use the helper function `p` since all plural messages are stored in one bundle  (the bundle name is specified in the i18n configuration).

```php
echo p('%s user', $userCount);
```

The provided code will find the appropriate string version of (`%s user`)
and inject a number into it. 

> You can provide a third boolean parameter to enable or disable number formatting (enabled by default).

Pluralized strings resolve based on the language formula described in i18n configuration and works differently for different languages.
For example English has only 2 forms, while Russian has 3. You can find language formulas for different languages here TODO: INCLUDE LINK.

> Pluralization functions are also indexable and can be grabbed without manually registering strings.

Spiral will not generate plural string form automatically, you have to either edit the bundle file (usually located in application/runtime/i18n/language/plural-phrases.php) to add the correct forms or use import/export
functionality.

## Localizing views
Besides using localization functions in the view source (both at runtime and compilation-time) you can perform localization via simplified string constructions by adding `[[` and `]]` to your string.

```html
...
	<a href="#">[[Logout]]</a>
	<p>
	[[Strings like that will be automatically indexed and
	replaced in a view compilation stage.]]
	</p>
...
```

Strings like that will be automatically indexed and replaced in the view compilation stage.
> The result of view localization is cached, so you can literally localize anything you want without worring about performance or memory usage. However you have to wipe or re-generate view cache after modifying your i18n bundle files.

## Localizing class messages
Spiral gives you a special component trait that can be used to create a bundle based on component aliases. Check the following example.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

This trait will allow not only the usage of the `i18nMessage` method but will also index every string declared in the default property values and encompassed with `[[` and `]]`.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

> `[[` and `]]` are not required for the i18nMessage() method but this prefix and postfix will be automatically removed to allow the localizwtion of strings defined as default property values.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage($this->messages['welcome']);
	}
}
```
> This technique is widely used to specify custom error mesagges for ODM and ORM validations.

```php

class User extends Document
{	
	...
	
	protected $validates = array(
		'email' => array(
			['required', 'error' => '[[Email is required.]]'],
			['email', 'error' => '[[Invalid email.]]']
		)
	);
}
```

You can also use i18nMessage() statically outside your class/model method, such usages are also captured well.

```php
echo HomeController::i18nMessage('Message from HomeController.');
```

> Both ORM and ODM models have LocalizableTrait enabled by default and can translate validation messages.

## Indexation
In many cases your string translation functions are located in blocks
which execute based on some condition. This means that spiral will not be able to capture and register such translations automatically. However, you can perform static analysis of your code
by running the console command `i18n:index`. This command will detect all
possible string usages in files (as fucntions) and classes (`self::i18nMessage()` method).

> Spiral can't capture strings translated using non-static methods of simplified functions (like `$this->i18n->get(...)` or `$this->i18nMessage()`).

## Edit translation
Once you have captured all your strings, you can edit the contents of your bundle files manually by editing their content in `application/runtime/i18n/language/` directory. Every bundle is represent as a simple php array and can be edited fairly easy.

## Edit translation even better
For many reasons you can't give set of php files to translators. Fortunatelly spiral has very easy way to export and import localization files into GetText PO format. Such format can be edited by many programs and can significantly simplify translation process.

[SCREENSHOT]

To export specified language to PO file execute:

After editing file you can import it back via (language name already embedded into file so you don't need to specify it).

> PO fully support plural phrases and can work with different language formulas.

## Runtime message edit
If you want to change string translation in runtime concider using set method of Translator (example given for controller action).

```php
$this->i18n->set('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', 'Hi, {name}!');
```
