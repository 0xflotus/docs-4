# Localization
Spiral provides an emdedded component to perform the contextual location for classes and views - Translator. 
Component can be requested directly as `Translator`, via a shortcut `i18n` or using facade `I18n`.

To get the component instance or facade, read the following topics: [Core Components] (core/bindings.md), 
[Facades] (core/facades.md). 

> Before you skip this section because you think "I don't need translations" - think about this. The i18n component can be used not only to perform real translation to mutliple languages but in a much easier way to manage your applications text resources even if it's only for one language. This means that if you want to
edit some error message, view string, etc. you can do this without opening the code editor.

## Principals
Spiral i18n component is built using the idea of original string as a base language in the localization key (same method is used in GetText). The only real difference between GetText and spiral i18n component is that the latter stores the localization string in separate files (in future `bundles`).
Such a method provides a better memory management for larger applications and group strings based on parent view, class or file.

Basic usage of i18n can be highlighted in following code:

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome');
```

To start localizing your code, you don't need to modify any PHP file as you might in other frameworks. Spiral will automatically register the string during the first usage or via indexation (see Indexation section).

In some cases, when the bundle name doesn't matter (generic messages), you can transate the string by using a simpified function (in this case all maessages will come from a "default" bundle).

```php
echo l('Welcome');
``` 

You can also use the Translator component directly without facade. However, doing it this way
is not recommended because spiral will not be able to index and capture strings you used via static analysis.

## Replacements
You can also use string interpolation while translating. To do this, simply provide the parameter with the array of replacements. This will add more context to your message.

```php
use Spiral\Facade\I18n;

echo I18n::get('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);
echo l('Welcome, {name}!', ['name' => $name]);

```

## Pluralization
Spiral provides a convenient way to get pluralized strings. You can either use facade or the helper function `p`, which we recommend. All plural messages will always be stored in one bundle (bundle name is specified in i18n configuration).

```php
echo p('%s user', $userCount);
```

The following code will find the corresponding string version of (`%s user`)
and inject number into it. 

> You can provide a third boolean parameter to enable or disable number formatting (this feature is enabled by default).

Pluralization string is resolved based on the language formula described in i18n configuration and works differently for different languages.
For example, English has only two forms, and something like Russian has three. You can find language formulas for different languages here TODO: INCLUDE LINK.

> Pluralization functions are also indexable and can be grabbed without manually registering strings.

Spiral will not generate plural string form automatically. Either you have to edit the bundle file to add correct forms (usually located in application/runtime/i18n/language/plural-phrases.php) or use the import/export
functionality.

## Localizing views
Besides using the localization functions in the view source (both in runtime and compiled php's), you can perform localization via a simplified string constructions by adding `[[` and `]]` to your string.

```html
...
	<a href="#">[[Logout]]</a>
	<p>
	[[Strings like this will be automatically indexed and
	replaced in a view compilation stage.]]
	</p>
...
```

Strings like this will be automatically indexed and replaced in a view compilation stage.
> The result of the view localization is cached, so you can literally localize anything you want without worrying about performance or memory usage. However, you should always wipe or re-generate view cache after modifying your i18n bundle files.

## Localizing class messages
Spiral gives you special component traits that can be used to create bundles based on component aliases. Check the following example.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

Trait allows not only the usage of `i18nMessage` method but will additionally index every string declared in default property value and/or embraced with `[[` and `]]`.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage('This is home contoller.');
	}
}
```

> `[[` and `]]` are not required for i18nMessage() method but this prefix and postfix will be automatically removed to allow localizing strings defined as default property values.

```php
use Spiral\Components\I18n\LocalizableTrait;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
	use LocalizableTrait;
	
	protected $messages = array(
		'welcome' => '[[Welcome!]]',
		'not-captured' => 'Simple text.'
	);
	
	public function index()
	{
		echo self::i18nMessage($this->messages['welcome']);
	}
}
```
> This technique is widely used to specify custom error mesagges for ODM and ORM validations.

```php

class User extends Document
{	
	...
	
	protected $validates = array(
		'email' => array(
			['required', 'error' => '[[Email is required.]]'],
			['email', 'error' => '[[Invalid email.]]']
		)
	);
}
```

You can also use i18nMessage() outside your class/model method and such usage is also captured with no problems.

```php
echo HomeController::i18nMessage('Message from HomeController.');
```

> Both ORM and ODM models has LocalizableTrait enabled by default and can translate validation messages.

## Indexation
In many cases, your string translation functions are located in blocks
which are executed based on some conditions etc. This means that Spiral will not be able to automatically capture and register such translations. However, you can perform a static analysis of your code
by running the console command `i18n:index`. This command will detect all
possible string usages in your files (as functions) and classes (`self::i18nMessage()` method).

> Spiral can't capture strings translated using non static method of simplified function (like `$this->i18n->get(...)` or `$this->i18nMessage()`).

## Edit translation
Once you have captured all your strings, you can manually edit the content of your bundle files in the `application/runtime/i18n/language/` directory. Every bundle is represented as a simple PHP array and can be edited easily.

## Edit translation even better
For a lot of reasons, you can't give a set of PHP files to a translator. Fortunatelly, Spiral has a very easy way to export and import localization files into GetText PO format. Such format can be edited by many programs and will  simplify the translation process. There are a number of good free PO editors online to help you with this. 

[SCREENSHOT]

To export specified language to PO file execute:

After editing the file, you can import it back (the language name is already embedded into your file so you don't need to specify it).

> PO fully supports the use of plural phrases and can work with different language formulas.

## Runtime message edit
If you want to change the string translation in runtime, consider using a set method of Translator (example given for controller action).

```php
$this->i18n->set('bundle-name', 'Welcome, {name}!', 'Hi, {name}!');
```
