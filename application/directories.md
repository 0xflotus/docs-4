# Directory structure
Spiral appliction does not require any specific stucture or namespace for it's files until every application class can be loaded by composer, however spiral scaffoling and cache directories comes pre-configured. Let's review default directory structure:

Directory                         | Description                    
---                               | ---       
/                                 | Base project directory (alias **root**).
**/app/**                         | This is your base application directory with templates, classes, runtime cache and etc (alias **application**)
/app/classes/                     | This directory mounted as PSR4 root in your application composer file.               
/app/classes/Bootloaders/         | You can locate your application and service bootloaders here if you wish.
/app/classes/Commands/            | Custom commands can be located here.   
/app/classes/Controllers/         | Application conbtrollers can be located here.          
/app/classes/Database/            | Database entities (ORM and ODM) and sources can be placed in this directory.                       
/app/classes/Middlewares/         | By default http middewares going to be scaffolded here.
/app/classes/Requests/            | Use it to store RequestFilters for your application.    
/app/classes/Models/              | Services, models and other business logic.
**/app/config/**                  | Configuration files of your application (alias **config**).    
/app/resources/                   | You can store private application resources here (alias **resources**).
/app/resources/locales/           | Default directory for application locale files (alias **locales**).
/app/runtime/                     | Files generated by your application in runtime like cache, logs and etc (alias **config**).
/app/runtime/cache/               | Default directory for application cache (alias **cache**).     
/app/runtime/logs/                | Default directory to store logs.                  
**/app/views/**                   | You can locate view files belongs to "default" namespace here (see views config).
/vendor/                          | Composer vendor directory, aliased under "libraries" directory.              
**/webroot/**                     | Application public directory, application enterpoint (index.php) located here as any other public asset file. Aliased as "public" directory.

> Spiral Framework bundle does not force any of default application namespaces except for http routing (see AppBootloader to change that), meaning you can construct your application way you want it. For example you can easily create ViewModels without any help from framework.

## Accessing directory aliases
As mention in directories description many of listed paths can be accessed using aliases, you can get directory alias using two similar methods:

```php
public function indexAction(DirectoriesInterface $directories)
{
   //You can use DirectoriesInterface
   dump($directories->directory('runtime'));
   
   //Or short function which works via shared container
   dump(directory('resources'));
}
```

> You can overwrite directories at moment of core initialization. If you wish to add more class "types" to your application be free to create directories and namespaces in "app/classes" as it marked as PSR4 root.
